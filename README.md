2. The application should provide endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users and roles.
3. The application should validate incoming data before processing it.
4. The application should handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.
5. The application should include unit tests to verify the functionality of the service.
6. It should be possible to run the application locally. Instructions for how to do this should be included in the README.
7. (Optional) The application should provide an authentication mechanism.

## Submission
